There are five applications:

* **aliss**
    the home page for aliss.engineclub.org which will host information, demos etc
* **depot**
    storage of resource data, and services API, using a mix of mongodb and postgresql (for geoDjango location stuff)
* **enginecab**
    admin app for the engineclub
* **firebox**
    for data collection code
* **ecutils**
    for utility code

Engineclub is a `Django`_ project, and uses `MongoDB`_ for the main resource data.

Installation instructions
=========================

There are two ways to install this application for use by your
projects; the easiest in most cases is to do a Git checkout
into a directory that's on your Python path::

    git clone http://github.com/snowcloud/engineclub.git

The other method is to download a packaged version and use Python's
``distutils`` to install it onto your Python path::

    wget http://github.com/snowcloud/engineclub/tarball/master
    # get the name of the downloaded file to use in the following steps
    ls snowcloud-engineclub*
    tar zxvf snowcloud-engineclub...
    cd snowcloud-engineclub...
    python setup.py install

Depending on your system configuration, you may need to prefix the
last command with ``sudo`` and supply your password to perform a
system-wide installation.

Following installation, you can do::

    cd ecengine
    ./manage.py syncdb --noinput

This will create the initial database and load an admin user from apps/aliss/fixtures/initial_data.json
You can then log in with username: admin and password: admin
