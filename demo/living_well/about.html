<p>The Living Well @ the Library is a service developed by Renfrewshire Libraries and other local organisations to provide community health and wellbeing information local to Renfrewshire.</p>

<p>Volunteers provide health and wellbeing information at drop-in sessions in local libraries. This site is part of the service, powered by the <a href="http://www.aliss.org/">ALISS engine</a>, an initiative supported by Long Term Conditions Alliance Scotland and Scottish Government.</p>

<p>The ALISS project aims to make information about local community services easier to find, with a particular focus on self management support for people living with long term conditions. The ALISS Engine indexes links to useful local support and makes those links openly available, liberating them from local data stores that are sometimes hard to find or access.</p>

<p>This site only searches the links that the LW@TL community partners have contributed and curated, ensuring that results are rich, local, relevant and current.</p>

<p>As with any data service, the results are only as good as the information found and added to the collection.  Weâ€™re bound to miss things. If you know of a club, organization or service not showing up do let us know. If you'd like to add your service or data to the collection or have any comments or ideas please get in touch [link]. </p>
